    <legend>About Me</legend>
    <p>I'm a software developer currently working in southwest Virginia.
    I love to make all sorts of things ranging from apps and arduino based temperature
    sensors, to home brewed beer & wine. If it has a purpose, an elegance, or a science - then
    I've most likely got an interest. I love trying out new things, and I'm not afraid to break
    them along the way. What better way to learn how to fix it?</p>

  <h4>Clipster</h4>
    <p>Clipster is an Open Source Rails engine to add clipboard code sharing to <em>any</em>
    existing rails application. Sure, there are plenty of paste-bin websites out there that
    support easy code-sharing. However, most often than not your code is proprietary intellectual
    property, and the last thing you want is to see it floating around on a public website.
    My <%=link_to "friend", "https://github.com/kwbock", :target=>"blank" %> and I created Clipster
    for just that reason. Give your developers all the features of popular paste-bins while keeping
    the pastes behind your own security and protection measures. Checkout the <%=link_to "demo", clipster_path%>
    or fork us on <%=link_to "GitHub", "https://github.com/kwbock/clipster"%></p>
  <h4>Gauss Crack</h4>
    <p>Gauss Crack was created in response to the <%=link_to "Gauss Virus", "http://mashable.com/2012/08/09/gauss-virus/"%>.
    The Gauss Virus contains an encrypted payload designed to target computers with a <em>very</em> specific
    configuration. In fact, the configuration is so specific, that the exact configuration required to decrypt
    the encrypted payload is still unknown! The virus employs a
    <%=link_to "very novel algorithm",
        "https://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208193781/The_Mystery_of_the_Encrypted_Gauss_Payload", :target=>"blank"%>
    to ensure the payload stays encrypted until its needed. Gauss Crack mimics the algorithm in
    an attempt to find the correct configuration so the payload can finally be decrypted and analyzed.
    See the <%=link_to "algorithm", "https://github.com/lightswitch05/gaussCrack"%>, or
    <%=link_to "download", "https://github.com/lightswitch05/gaussCrack/downloads"%> and test
    your system now.</p>
